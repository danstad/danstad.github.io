Welcome! I am PhD candidate in Economics at Rice University. My research focuses on education economics, and on the intersection of applied industrial organization and development economics.

**I am currently on the Job Market (2020-21)**. I will be available for interviews at the 2020 EEA Virtual Meeting, Nottingham, and at the 2021 ASSA Online Meeting, Chicago.

* [Developing Educational and Vocational Aspirations through International Child Sponsorship: Evidence from Kenya, Indonesia, and Mexico.](http://danstad.github.io/files/WP_aspirations1.pdf) (with Paul Glewwe, Phillip Ross, and Bruce Wydick). - _Revision submitted, World Development_  
  <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> The role of aspirations in facilitating movement out of poverty is a subject of increasing research in development economics. Previous work finds positive impacts from international child sponsorship on educational attainment, employment, and adult income. This paper seeks to ascertain whether the impacts of child sponsorship on educational outcomes may occur through elevated aspirations among sponsored children. Using an age-eligibility rule applied during program rollout to identify causal effects, we study whether international child sponsorship increases educational and vocational aspirations among a sample of 2,022 children in Kenya, Indonesia, and Mexico. While effects are heterogeneous, and strongest in Kenya, we find that, averaging over the three countries, sponsorship increased indices of self-esteem (0.25), optimism (0.26), aspirations (0.29) standard deviations respectively, and expected years of completed education (0.43 years). We find that sponsorship increases actual grade completion by 0.56 among children at the time of the survey, and mediation analysis suggests that the impact of sponsorship on aspirations is likely to mediate higher levels of grade completion. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that the positive impacts of child sponsorship stem partly through elevating aspirations. More generally, our research contributes to a larger literature suggesting that the alleviation of internal constraints among the poor is a strong complement to addressing their external constraints. </details>

 * [International Child Sponsorship Impact on the Intended Choice of Acquiring a Higher Education Degree: the Case of Rural Mexico.](http://danstad.github.io/files/WP_aspirations2_DP.pdf) - _Submitted_
    <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> This paper studies the impact of a child sponsorship program on the aspiration to acquire a higher education degree, among a sample of rural children in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas in the south of Mexico. To account for the program's selection of sponsored children, I estimate a binary Roy type model with unobservables generated by a one-factor structure. I further account for the children's income beliefs by directly eliciting their subjective expected returns to schooling. I find that the average treatment effect on the treated is positive and consistent with previous studies of the sponsorship program, although it is not statistically significant. Estimates of the marginal treatment effect show that the sponsorship effect is higher for children most likely to be selected to the program. From the subjective income expectations data, I document that children in rural settings, 12 to 15 years old, have realistic although heterogeneous expectations, and present a clear gender gap, even at these young ages. </details>
